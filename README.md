## 🛠️ Core Expertise

### AI Agents & LLMs
Specialized in building autonomous workflows. Key projects include **AI-Debate**, **Deep_Research_Agent**, and **Legion-Repair-Agent**.

### Machine Learning
Proficient in hyperparameter optimization (contributor to [optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna)), RL-based recommendations, and neural network development using [skorch](https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch).

### Data Engineering & Analytics
Experienced in building end-to-end pipelines, from **Web-Scrapping** to interactive dashboards like the **London-Bike-Rides-Dashboard**.

### Specialized AI
Developing niche solutions such as **Voice-to-SQL**, **Quantized-LLM in C++**, and **Mental-Health-AI-Coach**.
